## Get Oceancolor
This  is a script to easily get chlorophyll-a data from MODIS. It downloads various time-steps 
of chlorophyll data and subsets them according to the user's time and area of interest.

How it works: it gets the names of data files based on the search parameters, accesses the 
data files via OPeNDAP, subsets the data, and saves the subsetted data in the user's computer.

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

activate the environment

`conda activate get_oceancolor`

Then you edit the get_oceancolor.py file with the info of the data you'd like to access and download. Run the script. Your data should be saved in the data folder.

### Troubleshooting:
